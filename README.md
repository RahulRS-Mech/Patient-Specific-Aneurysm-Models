# Patient-Specific-Aneurysm-Models
This project focuses on **transforming real medical imaging data from AneuDesk into 3D-printed aneurysm models**, enabling detailed in-vitro hemodynamic studies. By leveraging **advanced segmentation techniques and CAD modeling**, we extracted aneurysm geometries from medical scans, processed them for smoothness and accuracy, and prepared them for 3D printing.  

These models closely mimic actual vascular structures, allowing researchers to **study blood flow behavior, velocity fields, and wall shear stress (WSS)** under controlled experimental conditions. This work bridges the gap between **patient-specific imaging and experimental research**, ensuring accurate aneurysm modeling for in-vitro analysis.
